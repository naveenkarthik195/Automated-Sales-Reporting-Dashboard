Automation X Data Analytics

🚀Automated Mens Store Sales Dashboard with Real-Time Notifications
I’m excited to share my mini project where I built an end-to-end automated analytics workflow, closely aligned with real-world business intelligence practices.

🔹 Project Overview:
•	Sales data is maintained in Google Sheets
•	A Looker Studio dashboard updates automatically when rows are added, edited, or removed
•	Zapier automation monitors spreadsheet changes
•	Formatter by Zapier is used to standardize and prepare data within the workflow (formatting & validation)
•	A Telegram bot sends the live dashboard link in real time
•	Dashboard access is securely restricted to authorized users only

🔹 Key Concepts Implemented:
•	Real-time dashboard updates (row-level automation)
•	BI workflow design (data source → transformation → visualization → notification)
•	Rule-based data validation and handling of incomplete records
•	Clear understanding of the role and limits of automated data cleaning
•	Secure dashboard sharing for clients and stakeholders

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used:
•	Google Sheets
•	Looker Studio
•	Zapier
•	Formatter by Zapier
•	Telegram Bot
